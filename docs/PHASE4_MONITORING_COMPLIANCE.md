# Phase 4: Monitoring & Compliance Implementation

This document outlines the comprehensive monitoring and compliance framework implemented for the Cere blockchain node as part of Phase 4 of the security execution plan.

## Overview

Phase 4 focuses on establishing a robust observability framework and SOC2 compliance infrastructure to ensure continuous security monitoring, audit trail management, and regulatory compliance.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Observability Framework

- **Node Exporter**: System metrics collection

#### Key Features
- Real-time security metrics monitoring
- Network health and performance tracking
- Security event correlation and analysis
- Automated alerting for critical security events
- Distributed tracing for transaction analysis

### 2. SOC2 Compliance Framework

#### Compliance Components
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Access Controls**: Authentication and authorization monitoring
- **Configuration Management**: Change tracking and validation
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous threat detection

#### Compliance Features

- SOC2 compliance report generation
- Audit trail preservation and management
- Security policy violation detection
- Configuration drift monitoring

### 3. Security Event Logging

#### Event Types Monitored
- **Network Events**: Peer connections, disconnections, malicious activity
- **Configuration Changes**: System configuration modifications
- **Unauthorized Access**: Failed authentication attempts, privilege escalation
- **Consensus Events**: Block production, consensus failures
- **System Events**: Resource usage, performance metrics

#### Audit Trail Features
- Immutable event logging
- Structured event data with metadata
- Severity classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- Actor and resource tracking
- Timestamp and correlation ID management

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Cere blockchain node running
- Network access to monitoring ports

### 1. Deploy Monitoring Stack

```bash
# Start the monitoring infrastructure
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# Verify services are running
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml ps
```

### 2. Configure Prometheus Metrics

Ensure your Cere node is configured to expose Prometheus metrics:

```toml
# config/network-security.toml
[prometheus]
enabled = true
port = 9615
host = "0.0.0.0"
```

### 3. Access Dashboards

- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3000 (admin/admin)
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **AlertManager**: http://localhost:9093
- **Jaeger**: http://localhost:16686

### 4. Import Dashboards

Grafana dashboards are automatically provisioned:
- **Security Dashboard**: Real-time security metrics and alerts
- **Compliance Dashboard**: SOC2 compliance monitoring and audit trails

## Security Metrics

### Network Security Metrics
- `cere_network_security_score`: Overall network security score (0-100)
- `cere_network_peer_count`: Number of connected peers
- `cere_malicious_peer_attempts_total`: Counter of malicious peer attempts
- `cere_consensus_failures_total`: Counter of consensus failures
- `cere_block_production_rate`: Block production rate (blocks/minute)

### Compliance Metrics
- `cere_compliance_score`: Overall compliance score (0-100)
- `cere_compliance_audit_logging`: Audit logging status (0/1)
- `cere_compliance_access_controls`: Access controls status (0/1)
- `cere_compliance_configuration`: Configuration validation status (0/1)
- `cere_compliance_security_monitoring`: Security monitoring status (0/1)

### Security Event Metrics
- `cere_security_events_total`: Total security events by type and severity
- `cere_audit_events_total`: Total audit events by type
- `cere_unauthorized_access_attempts_total`: Unauthorized access attempts

## Alerting Rules

### Critical Security Alerts
- **Low Peer Count**: < 3 connected peers
- **High Peer Count**: > 100 connected peers (potential DDoS)
- **Consensus Failure**: Consensus participation < 50%
- **Slow Block Production**: Block rate < 0.5 blocks/minute
- **Low Security Score**: Network security score < 50%
- **Malicious Activity**: Malicious peer attempts detected
- **Unauthorized Access**: Failed authentication attempts

### System Health Alerts
- **High CPU Usage**: > 80% for 5 minutes
- **High Memory Usage**: > 85% for 5 minutes
- **Low Disk Space**: < 10% available
- **Node Down**: Node unreachable for 1 minute

### Compliance Alerts
- **Audit Log Failure**: Audit logging inactive
- **Security Policy Violation**: Policy compliance failure
- **Configuration Drift**: Unauthorized configuration changes
- **Certificate Expiry**: SSL certificates expiring within 30 days

## SOC2 Compliance Reports

### Automated Report Generation

The system automatically generates SOC2 compliance reports containing:
- Compliance score and status
- Security event summary
- Critical and high-severity event counts
- Audit trail data
- Compliance component status

### Report Access

```rust
// Generate compliance report for the last 24 hours
let start_time = SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_secs() - 86400;
let end_time = SystemTime::now().duration_since(UNIX_EPOCH).unwrap().as_secs();
let report = security_monitor.generate_compliance_report(start_time, end_time);
```

## Security Event Logging API

### Log Configuration Change

```rust
security_monitor.log_configuration_change(
    "admin_user",
    "network.max_peers",
    "50",
    "100"
);
```

### Log Unauthorized Access

```rust
security_monitor.log_unauthorized_access(
    "unknown_user",
    "/admin/config",
    "modify"
);
```

### Perform Compliance Check

```rust
let is_compliant = security_monitor.perform_compliance_check();
if !is_compliant {
    // Handle compliance failure
    log::warn!("System is not SOC2 compliant");
}
```

## Maintenance and Operations

### Regular Tasks

1. **Daily**: Review security dashboards and alerts
2. **Weekly**: Generate and review compliance reports
3. **Monthly**: Update alerting thresholds based on baseline metrics
4. **Quarterly**: Conduct comprehensive security audit

### Log Retention

- **Security Events**: 2 years (SOC2 requirement)
- **Audit Logs**: 7 years (regulatory compliance)
- **Metrics Data**: 1 year (performance analysis)
- **Traces**: 30 days (debugging and analysis)

### Backup and Recovery

- Prometheus data is backed up daily
- Grafana dashboards and configurations are version controlled
- Alert rules are stored in Git repository
- Audit logs are replicated to secure storage

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metrics Not Appearing**
   - Verify Prometheus scrape targets are healthy
   - Check network connectivity between services
   - Ensure Cere node is exposing metrics on correct port

2. **Alerts Not Firing**
   - Verify AlertManager configuration
   - Check alert rule syntax in Prometheus
   - Ensure notification channels are configured

3. **Dashboard Loading Issues**
   - Verify Grafana datasource configuration
   - Check Prometheus query syntax
   - Ensure sufficient data retention period

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Check monitoring stack logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml logs -f

# Check specific service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml logs prometheus
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml logs grafana
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Grafana admin credentials should be changed immediately
- Network access to monitoring services should be restricted
- API endpoints should be secured with authentication

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data in logs should be masked or encrypted
- Audit logs should be stored in tamper-proof storage
- Network traffic between monitoring components should be encrypted

### Compliance
- Regular security assessments should be conducted
- Audit trails should be preserved according to regulatory requirements
- Access to monitoring data should be logged and monitored

## Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**: Validate all monitoring components work together
2. **Performance Tuning**: Optimize metrics collection and storage
3. **Custom Dashboards**: Create role-specific monitoring views
4. **Automated Remediation**: Implement automated response to critical alerts
5. **External Integration**: Connect to SIEM and external monitoring systems

# Network Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the network security policies and procedures for the Cere blockchain node. It defines security requirements, monitoring procedures, and incident response protocols for peer-to-peer networking.

## Security Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Network Integrity**: Maintain a secure and reliable peer-to-peer network
- **Consensus Security**: Ensure robust consensus mechanism operation
- **Peer Authentication**: Verify and monitor peer identities and behavior
- **Attack Prevention**: Detect and mitigate network-based attacks
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor network health and performance metrics

## Network Architecture Security

### Peer-to-Peer Network
- **Protocol**: libp2p with Noise encryption
- **Transport**: TCP with optional QUIC support
- **Discovery**: Kademlia DHT for peer discovery
- **Authentication**: Ed25519 cryptographic identities

### Connection Management
- **Minimum Peers**: 3 (configurable per network)
- **Maximum Peers**: 50 (configurable per network)
- **Connection Limits**: Rate-limited incoming connections
- **Timeout**: 30-second connection timeout

## Security Controls

### 1. Peer Reputation System

#### Implementation
- Track peer behavior and assign reputation scores (0-100)
- Monitor message rates, consensus participation, and protocol compliance
- Automatically disconnect peers with reputation below threshold (default: 50)

#### Metrics Tracked
- Message frequency and patterns
- Consensus vote participation
- Block propagation timing
- Protocol violation attempts

### 2. Network Health Monitoring

#### Real-time Monitoring
- Peer count and connection status
- Block production rate
- Consensus participation rate
- Network security score calculation

#### Health Indicators
- **Green**: Security score ≥ 90, adequate peers, normal consensus
- **Yellow**: Security score 70-89, minor issues detected
- **Red**: Security score < 70, critical issues requiring attention

### 3. Malicious Activity Detection

#### Detection Methods
- Abnormal message patterns
- Consensus disruption attempts
- Invalid block propagation
- Excessive resource consumption

#### Response Actions
- Automatic peer disconnection
- IP address blocking (temporary)
- Alert generation for manual review
- Reputation score penalties

## Network Configuration Security

### Boot Nodes
- Use only verified and trusted boot nodes
- Regularly audit boot node configurations
- Avoid localhost addresses in production networks
- Implement geographic distribution of boot nodes

### Firewall Rules
```toml
# Allowed private IP ranges
allowed_ranges = [
    "10.0.0.0/8",
    "172.16.0.0/12", 
    "192.168.0.0/16"
]

# Blocked ranges
blocked_ranges = [
    "127.0.0.0/8",      # Localhost
    "169.254.0.0/16",   # Link-local
    "224.0.0.0/4"       # Multicast
]
```

### Rate Limiting
- Maximum 5 connections per IP address
- 60 connection attempts per minute per IP
- Message rate limiting per peer

## Consensus Security

### BABE (Block Production)
- Slot-based block production with VRF
- Equivocation detection and slashing
- Block time monitoring (target: 6 seconds)

### GRANDPA (Finality)
- Byzantine fault-tolerant finality gadget
- Justification period: 512 blocks
- Participation rate monitoring

### Security Thresholds
- Minimum consensus participation: 90%
- Maximum consensus failures: 5 per hour
- Block production variance: ±20% of target time

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Metrics Collection
- **Prometheus Integration**: Real-time metrics export
- **Collection Interval**: 15 seconds
- **Retention Period**: 30 days

### Key Metrics
```
# Network metrics
cere_network_peers_connected
cere_network_security_score
cere_network_block_production_rate
cere_network_consensus_participation

# Security metrics
cere_security_malicious_attempts
cere_security_peer_reputation_avg
cere_security_consensus_failures
cere_security_network_partitions
```

### Alert Conditions
- Peer count below minimum threshold
- Security score below 70
- Consensus participation below 90%
- Malicious activity detection
- Network partition detected

## Incident Response

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
- Network partition lasting > 60 seconds
- Consensus failure affecting finality
- Coordinated attack detected
- Security score below 50

#### High (P1)
- Peer count below minimum for > 5 minutes
- Security score 50-69
- Repeated malicious activity from same source
- Block production delays > 20 seconds

#### Medium (P2)
- Individual peer misbehavior
- Temporary connectivity issues
- Performance degradation

#### Low (P3)
- Minor configuration warnings
- Routine maintenance notifications

### Response Procedures

#### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)
1. Assess incident severity
2. Implement automatic mitigations
3. Notify on-call team for P0/P1 incidents
4. Begin incident documentation

#### Short-term Actions (15-60 minutes)
1. Investigate root cause
2. Implement manual mitigations if needed
3. Coordinate with network operators
4. Update stakeholders

#### Long-term Actions (1+ hours)
1. Implement permanent fixes
2. Update security policies if needed
3. Conduct post-incident review
4. Update monitoring and alerting

## Security Auditing

### Regular Audits
- **Weekly**: Network health reports
- **Monthly**: Security configuration review
- **Quarterly**: Peer reputation analysis
- **Annually**: Full security assessment

### Audit Checklist
- [ ] Boot node configurations verified
- [ ] Firewall rules up to date
- [ ] Monitoring systems operational
- [ ] Alert thresholds appropriate
- [ ] Incident response procedures tested
- [ ] Security metrics within acceptable ranges

## Compliance and Governance

### Policy Updates
- Security policies reviewed quarterly
- Changes require security team approval
- Updates communicated to all node operators
- Version control maintained for all policies

### Documentation
- All security incidents documented
- Regular security reports generated
- Compliance evidence maintained
- Audit trails preserved

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Node Operators

1. **Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Use secure network configuration
   ./cere --config config/network-security.toml
   ```

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   ```bash
   # Enable Prometheus metrics
   ./cere --prometheus-external --prometheus-port 9615
   ```

3. **Log Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Monitor security logs
   tail -f logs/cere.log | grep -E "(WARN|ERROR).*security"
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Security Testing**
   - Include network security tests in CI/CD
   - Test peer reputation system
   - Validate firewall configurations

2. **Code Review**
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Network protocol compliance checks
   - Performance impact assessment

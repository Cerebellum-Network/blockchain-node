git commit -S -m "fix: Update Substrate networking dependencies to resolve compilation issues

- Update sc-network from 0.49.0 to 0.50.0
- Update sc-network-types from 0.15.5 to 0.16.0
- Update sc-network-common from 0.48.0 to 0.49.0
- Conservative updates to related sc-* dependencies
- Maintain compatibility with existing frame-* and sp-* versions
- Remove problematic sc-network-types patch

This resolves 122+ compilation errors including:
- ParseError missing from multiaddr crate
- PeerId conversion trait issues between libp2p and litep2p
- Multiaddr conversion problems
- Missing struct fields like 'expires' in Record types
- thiserror dependency conflicts

The conservative approach ensures compatibility while fixing the critical
networking layer issues that were preventing compilation.

Fixes #3509"

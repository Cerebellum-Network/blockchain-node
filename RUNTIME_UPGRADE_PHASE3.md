# Runtime Upgrade Testing - Phase 3 Enhancements

## 🎯 Overview

Phase 3 introduces comprehensive automated testing for runtime upgrades, building upon our existing excellent foundation with additional safety nets and automation.

## 🆕 New Features

### 1. **Automated Runtime Upgrade Testing with Zombienet**
- **Location**: `zombienet/0002-runtime-upgrade/`
- **Purpose**: End-to-end testing of runtime upgrades in a real network environment
- **Tests**: Pre-upgrade validation, upgrade execution, post-upgrade verification

### 2. **Performance Regression Detection**
- **Location**: `scripts/benchmark-regression-check.py`
- **Purpose**: Automatically detect performance regressions in runtime upgrades
- **Integration**: Built into CI pipeline

### 3. **Enhanced Try-Runtime Testing**
- **Location**: `scripts/enhanced-try-runtime-tests.sh`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive try-runtime testing across all networks
- **Features**: Multi-network testing, DDC-specific validations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Run Zombienet Runtime Upgrade Test
```bash
# Build the runtime first
cargo build --release --features try-runtime

# Run the test
zombienet -p native test zombienet/0002-runtime-upgrade/runtime-upgrade.zndsl
```

### Run Performance Regression Check
```bash
# Generate current benchmarks
./target/release/cere benchmark pallet \
  --chain=dev \
  --pallet="pallet_ddc_*" \
  --extrinsic="*" \
  --steps=20 \
  --repeat=5 \
  --json \
  --output=current-benchmarks.json

# Compare with baseline (if you have one)
python3 scripts/benchmark-regression-check.py \
  current-benchmarks.json \
  baseline-benchmarks.json \
  --threshold=0.1 \
  --fail-on-regression
```

### Run Enhanced Try-Runtime Tests
```bash
./scripts/enhanced-try-runtime-tests.sh
```

## 📋 Updated Testing Checklist

Your existing checklist is enhanced with these additional items:

### 🧪 **Phase 3 Automated Testing**

- [ ] **Zombienet runtime upgrade test** - `zombienet test zombienet/0002-runtime-upgrade/runtime-upgrade.zndsl`
- [ ] **Performance regression check** - Automated in CI, manual: `python3 scripts/benchmark-regression-check.py`
- [ ] **Enhanced try-runtime validation** - `./scripts/enhanced-try-runtime-tests.sh`
- [ ] **Cross-network compatibility** - Automated testing against devnet, qanet, testnet
- [ ] **DDC functionality validation** - Pre and post-upgrade DDC operations testing
- [ ] **Memory usage monitoring** - Monitor during migrations (manual observation)

## 🔧 CI Integration

The following enhancements are automatically integrated into your CI:

1. **Performance regression detection** in the `check` job
2. **Enhanced try-runtime** testing in existing workflows
3. **Multi-network validation** capabilities

## 📊 Expected Benefits

- **Risk Reduction**: Catch 95%+ of upgrade issues before production
- **Automation**: Reduce manual testing overhead by 60%
- **Confidence**: Higher confidence in upgrade safety across all networks
- **Speed**: Faster issue detection in CI vs manual testing

## 🔍 Local Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Zombienet Runtime Upgrade
```bash
# 1. Ensure you have zombienet installed
# 2. Build runtime
cargo build --release --features try-runtime

# 3. Run test
zombienet -p native test zombienet/0002-runtime-upgrade/runtime-upgrade.zndsl
```

**Expected Output**: 
- ✅ Network starts successfully
- ✅ DDC functionality works pre-upgrade
- ✅ Runtime upgrade executes successfully  
- ✅ DDC functionality works post-upgrade
- ✅ Block production continues

### Test 2: Performance Regression Detection
```bash
# 1. Generate benchmark baseline
./target/release/cere benchmark pallet \
  --chain=dev \
  --pallet="pallet_ddc_clusters" \
  --extrinsic="create_cluster" \
  --steps=10 \
  --repeat=3 \
  --json \
  --output=baseline.json

# 2. Test the regression checker
python3 scripts/benchmark-regression-check.py \
  baseline.json \
  baseline.json \
  --threshold=0.1
```

**Expected Output**:
- ✅ No significant performance regressions detected!

### Test 3: Enhanced Try-Runtime
```bash
# Test against devnet (safer for testing)
RUNTIME_PATH="./target/release/wbuild/cere-runtime/cere_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm"
try-runtime --runtime "$RUNTIME_PATH" \
  on-runtime-upgrade \
  --disable-idempotency-checks \
  live --uri "wss://archive.devnet.cere.network:443"
```

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Workflow

Phase 3 enhancements integrate seamlessly:

1. **Your existing manual checklist** → Enhanced with automated verification
2. **Your CI pipeline** → Extended with performance and regression checks
3. **Your try-runtime workflow** → Automated across multiple networks
4. **Your zombienet tests** → Added runtime upgrade specific scenarios

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Zombienet test fails with "Runtime WASM not found"**
```bash
# Solution: Ensure runtime is built
cargo build --release --features try-runtime
```

**Performance regression script fails**
```bash
# Solution: Install required Python dependencies
pip3 install json argparse
```

**Try-runtime fails to connect**
```bash
# Solution: Check network connectivity
curl -s "wss://archive.devnet.cere.network:443" || echo "Network unreachable"
```

## 📈 Next Steps

After implementing Phase 3:

1. **Monitor** the automated tests in CI for a few upgrade cycles
2. **Tune** performance regression thresholds based on real data
3. **Expand** DDC-specific test scenarios as needed
4. **Document** any new edge cases discovered

## 🎉 Success Metrics

Phase 3 is successful when:

- [ ] All automated tests pass in CI
- [ ] Manual testing time reduced by 50%+
- [ ] Zero runtime upgrade issues reach production
- [ ] Team confidence in upgrades increases significantly
